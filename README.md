### What I learned
Developing this project was a thrilling journey. A start of something new and exciting expecially as it is the first challenge I've embarked on from <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">devChallenges.io</a>.

I incorporated semantic HTML structure and explored responsive design techniques with CSS, including flexbox and custom properties. I also practiced structuring my project better and pushing commits consistently with Git.


### Useful resources
- [CHATGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - This helped me understand git and it's concepts. I'll recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the basics of git.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - Helped solidify my understanding of flexbox.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


## Features
- Clean and responsive layout
- Beginner-friendly design

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
