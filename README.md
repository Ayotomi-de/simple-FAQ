### What I learned
Developing this project was both fun and enlightening! As my very first challenge from [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io), it gave me a practical chance to apply and strengthen the basics I‚Äôve been learning.

Here‚Äôs what I gained from the experience:

- üß† **Improved my understanding of HTML structure** by using semantic tags like `<main>`, `<footer>`.
- üé® **Practiced CSS styling techniques**, including flexbox layouts, spacing, font customization, and media responsiveness.
- üìÅ **Learned better file organization** ‚Äî I grouped assets like screenshots properly into folders for a cleaner project.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Worked with Git and GitHub** more confidently ‚Äî writing commit messages, pushing changes, and understanding how to sync my local repo with GitHub.
- üß™ **Debugged live site issues** like broken image paths‚Äî I learned how important testing and checking deployment is!

This project was a great way to build my confidence and get hands-on with front-end development. I‚Äôm proud of how it turned out and excited for the next challenge!
